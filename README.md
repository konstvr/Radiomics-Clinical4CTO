# Improving the accuracy of AI models by combining Clinical and Radiomics data

## About The Model
The concept was tested on predicting the success of wire crossing in patients with Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO). This repository contains the trained XGBoost model as well as a python notebook with the code that was used for training. The included model is the one with the best performance and has been trained on both Radiomics and Clinical data.
