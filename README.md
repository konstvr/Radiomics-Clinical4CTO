# Improving the accuracy of AI models by combining Clinical and Radiomics data

## About The Model
The concept was tested on predicting the success of wire crossing in patients with Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO). This repository contains the trained [XGBoost model](xgb_model_combined.joblib) as well as a [python notebook](Radiomics_Clinical4CTO.ipynb) with the code that was used for training. The included model is the one with the best performance and has been trained on both Radiomics and Clinical data.

### Webapp
An online demo of our model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ObiWan-AI-ground/Radiomics_Clinical4CTO_app)
